# projet01_get_next_line
A little function to get the next line in a fd on an alloced memory space pointed by a pointer you give in params.
Some function from my libft are used.

Return(0) when there is nothing to read, -1 if an error occured, 1 if you are not at the end of the file pointed by the fd.
